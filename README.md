# Yolo-v3-Object-Detection-in-Tensorflow <br/>
 <br/>
Yolo is an algorithm that uses convolutional neural networks for object detection. <br/>
So what's great about object detection? In comparison to recognition algorithms, a detection algorithm does not only predict class labels, but detects locations of  <br/>objects as well. <br/>
